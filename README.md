    <h2><strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application </strong></h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the university of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    
    <h3>Starting date</h3>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester, the starty dates for each one are as follows: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datatime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li>Second semester: <time datatime="2017-01-15"> 15 January 2016</time></li>
        <li>Third semester: <time datatime="2017-05-02"> 2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>
    <p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university date</a> on our web site.</p>
    <h3>Subject of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reserch facility &#8211; as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem intelligent, dedicated resercher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&#8451;(86&#8457;), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> ) </li>
            <li><abbr title="HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CASCADING STYLE SHEETS">CSS</abbr> construct for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd need to know? thanks.</p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A litte known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruifull".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, thtey used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow student used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believe to have discovered a new dance style charaterised by  "robotics",stilted movement, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. later on however it was discoverd that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>
